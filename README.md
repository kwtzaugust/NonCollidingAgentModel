# NonCollidingAgentModel

Modified from BasicAgentModel code by SUTD ESD Assistant Professor Nuno A. Ribeiro.  
This model has a much smaller waiting area, consisting of 9 'seats'. Patients will wait one of the 9 seats. If no seats are available, patients will leave the system even if they had not been treated.
Model can be run on glitch.me: hhttps://kwtzaugust-noncollidingagentmodel.glitch.me/
